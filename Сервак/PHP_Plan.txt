PHP/MySQL 'GET' server

  Is used for:
	-Logging in
	-Matchmaking
	-Players' profiles
	-Leaderboards*
	
  Architecture:
	-Players send requests to the server when logging
	-Server gets them and responds (true or false), based on MySQL data it has
	-If a player gets a negative response or doesn't get it at all - online functions are disabled.
	Howewer, you they can still try to reconnect
	-Otherwise, the player can now play online with other players or see the leaderboards
	
	-When a player presses the "Play online" button, the client sends an http request, 
	which contains the player's name.
	-The server adds these name and MMR to its "Searching now" MySQL database.
	-Then server sends the whole database to the client (needed to find mmr-equal opponents)
	-The client waits until it finds a perfect opponent (if there is no such, "perfect opponent" conditions
	become easier to fit with time) 
	For example: in first 2 seconds match only makes if there is an opponent with exactly the same MMR,
	then range of required MMR becomes wider, alowing the player to fall against not so worthy opponent.
	-Finaly, when a game is found, player sends the request again, to let server know about start of the game.
	Server deletes the player and his opponent from the database to ensure noone will try to make a match with him.
	Server sends a respond to both players and they connect to the Python socket server.
	
	For profiles and leaderboards it's actually pretty simple:
	-Client requests to see some info
	-Server responds, sending that info to the client
	

Python socket server

  Is used for:
	-Multiplayer matches in real time
	
  Architecture:
	-When a client is connected, server creates an entry in his clients list
	-If the connection is failed - the match shuts
	-Players(clients) send their x/y/rotation/other_physics_stuff to the server (in bin buffer format)
	-Server gets the data and stores it in its list
	-As often as possible, server sends the data back to all clients
	-Clients use the data they get by creating/changing instances of other players and stuff they made
